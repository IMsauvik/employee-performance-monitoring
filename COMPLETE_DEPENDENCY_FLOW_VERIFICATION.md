# üîÑ COMPLETE DEPENDENCY FLOW - VERIFICATION & FIX GUIDE

## üìã THE COMPLETE FLOW (As It Should Work)

### Step 1: Employee Blocks Task
1. Employee opens task in `EmployeeTaskDetailModal`
2. Changes status to "BLOCKED"  
3. `showBlockedModal` opens
4. Enters reason and mentions users (optional)
5. Submits blocker

**Expected Result**:
- Task status ‚Üí BLOCKED
- `blockerHistory` array updated with blocker entry
- `isBlocked` flag set to true
- Mentioned users get notifications

### Step 2: Manager Views Blocked Task
1. Manager opens blocked task
2. Views in `TaskDetailModal` or `BlockerTaskModal`
3. Sees blocker reason and "Dependency Tasks" section
4. Clicks **"Create Dependencies"** button

**Expected Result**:
- `CreateDependencyModal` opens
- Shows parent task info and blocker reason

### Step 3: Manager Creates Dependency Tasks
1. In `CreateDependencyModal`:
   - Enter dependency title
   - Enter description
   - Assign to employee(s)
   - Set due date
2. Click "Create"

**Expected Result**:
- Dependency tasks INSERT into `dependency_tasks` table with UUID
- Each assigned employee gets notification
- Parent task's `blockerHistory` updated with dependency IDs
- Success toast appears

### Step 4: Assigned Employee Views Dependencies
1. Employee logs in
2. Goes to "My Tasks" dashboard (`EmployeeDashboard.jsx`)
3. Sees **"Dependency Tasks Assigned to You"** section
4. Views dependency cards with status

**Expected Result**:
- Section appears (only if `dependencyTasks.length > 0`)
- Shows cards: Not Started, In Progress, Completed tabs
- Displays task details and parent task reference

### Step 5: Employee Opens Dependency
1. Employee clicks on dependency card
2. `DependencyTaskDetailModal` opens

**Expected Result**:
- Modal shows:
  - Dependency title & description
  - Parent task reference  
  - Status selector
  - Progress notes section
  - Activity timeline
  - Submit button

### Step 6: Employee Works on Dependency
1. Updates status: Not Started ‚Üí In Progress
2. Adds progress notes
3. Eventually marks as "Completed"

**Expected Result**:
- Status updates save to database
- Progress notes append to array
- Activity timeline updates
- Parent task owner gets notification

### Step 7: Manager Reviews & Accepts
1. Manager opens parent (blocked) task
2. Views dependency tasks list
3. Sees completed dependency
4. Clicks **"Accept"** button

**Expected Result**:
- Dependency marked as accepted
- `acceptedBy`, `acceptedAt` fields updated
- Assignee gets notification

### Step 8: Auto-Unblock Parent Task
When ALL dependencies for a blocker are accepted:

**Expected Result**:
- Parent task status ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS automatically
- Blocker marked as `resolved: true`
- `resolvedBy`, `resolvedAt`, `autoResolved: true` set
- Employee can continue working

## üêõ ISSUES TO CHECK

### Issue 1: "Create Dependencies" Button Not Showing

**Check in `BlockerTaskModal.jsx`**:
```javascript
// Line ~368
{currentUser.role !== 'employee' && (
  <button onClick={() => setShowCreateDependency(true)}>
    Create Dependencies
  </button>
)}
```

**Possible Problems**:
- User role is 'employee' (only managers/admins can create)
- `isBlocked` is false
- Button exists but modal doesn't open

**Fix**: Verify `currentUser.role` and `showCreateDependency` state

### Issue 2: Dependencies Not Saving

**Check Console Logs** (we added these):
```
üîµ Creating dependency task: {...}
‚úÖ Dependency task created with ID: [uuid]
```

**If you see errors**:
- Check database INSERT errors
- Verify assigned user exists
- Check RLS policies allow INSERT

**Fix**: Run diagnostic queries in Supabase

### Issue 3: Dependencies Not Showing in Dashboard

**Check Console Logs**:
```
üîµ Loading dependency tasks for user: [uuid]
üìä Found X dependency tasks
```

**If "Found 0"**:
- Check if dependencies were actually created
- Verify `assigned_to` matches current user ID
- Check RLS policies allow SELECT

**Fix**: Run SQL query to verify data exists

### Issue 4: Dependency Modal Not Opening

**Check in `EmployeeDashboard.jsx`**:
```javascript
// Line ~260
onClick={() => setSelectedDependencyId(dep.id)}
```

**Check if**:
- `selectedDependencyId` is set
- `DependencyTaskDetailModal` is rendered
- Modal has proper z-index

**Fix**: Add console log to track click events

### Issue 5: Accept Button Not Working

**Check in `EmployeeTaskDetailModal.jsx`** or wherever accept is:
```javascript
await db.updateFullDependencyTask(dependencyId, {
  acceptedBy: currentUser.id,
  acceptedAt: now,
  status: 'accepted'
});
```

**Possible Problems**:
- Update fails silently
- Wrong dependency ID
- RLS policy blocks UPDATE

**Fix**: Check Supabase logs for errors

## üîß QUICK FIXES

### Fix 1: Add Missing "Mentioned" Field

**In your screenshot**, I see "Mentioned:" with no users.

**Check in `EmployeeTaskDetailModal.jsx`** where blocker is created:
```javascript
const blockerEntry = {
  id: `blocker-${Date.now()}`,
  blockedBy: currentUser.id,
  blockedByName: currentUser.name,
  blockedAt: now,
  reason: blockerComment,
  mentions: mentionedUsers, // ‚úÖ This should be here
  resolved: false
};
```

**Verify** the UI shows mentions properly.

### Fix 2: Ensure Create Dependencies Button Appears

Add this check in `BlockerTaskModal.jsx`:
```javascript
console.log('Current user role:', currentUser.role);
console.log('Is blocked:', isBlocked);
console.log('Should show button:', isBlocked && currentUser.role !== 'employee');
```

### Fix 3: Force Dashboard Section to Show (For Testing)

Temporarily change in `EmployeeDashboard.jsx`:
```javascript
// Line ~187
{true && (  // Always show for testing
  <div className="bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-lg p-6 mb-6">
    <h3>Dependency Tasks Assigned to You</h3>
    {dependencyTasks.length === 0 ? (
      <p>No dependencies found</p>
    ) : (
      // ... render cards
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

## üîç DIAGNOSTIC SQL QUERIES

### Check if Dependencies Exist
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    title,
    status,
    assigned_to,
    assigned_to_name,
    parent_task_id,
    parent_task_name,
    created_at
FROM dependency_tasks
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Specific User's Dependencies
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM dependency_tasks 
WHERE assigned_to = 'YOUR_EMPLOYEE_USER_UUID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check Blocked Tasks
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    title,
    status,
    is_blocked,
    blocker_history::text
FROM tasks
WHERE is_blocked = true
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

### Check if Table Exists
```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
    WHERE table_name = 'dependency_tasks'
);
```

### Manually Insert Test Dependency
```sql
INSERT INTO dependency_tasks (
    title,
    description,
    status,
    parent_task_id,
    parent_task_name,
    assigned_to,
    assigned_to_name,
    assigned_by,
    assigned_by_name,
    due_date
) VALUES (
    'Test Manual Dependency',
    'Testing if dashboard displays this',
    'not_started',
    (SELECT id FROM tasks LIMIT 1),
    'Test Parent Task',
    'YOUR_EMPLOYEE_UUID', -- Replace with actual employee UUID
    'Employee Name',
    'YOUR_MANAGER_UUID', -- Replace with actual manager UUID
    'Manager Name',
    CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '7 days'
);

-- Then refresh dashboard to see if it appears
```

## üìä EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT

### When Creating Dependency:
```
üîµ Creating dependency task: {title: "Fix bug", assignedTo: "abc-123", ...}
‚úÖ Dependency task created with ID: def-456-uuid
```

### When Loading Dashboard:
```
üîµ Loading dependency tasks for user: abc-123
üîµ Querying dependency_tasks for assignee: abc-123
‚úÖ Raw data from database: [{id: "def-456", ...}]
üìä Found 1 dependency tasks
‚úÖ Dependency tasks loaded: 1 tasks
```

### When Opening Modal:
```
üîµ Opening dependency modal for ID: def-456
‚úÖ Dependency task loaded: {title: "Fix bug", ...}
```

---

## ‚úÖ SUMMARY

**The flow SHOULD work as**:
1. Employee blocks task ‚Üí Manager sees blocker
2. Manager clicks "Create Dependencies" ‚Üí Modal opens
3. Manager creates dependencies ‚Üí Saves to `dependency_tasks` table
4. Employee sees in dashboard ‚Üí "Dependency Tasks Assigned to You"
5. Employee clicks card ‚Üí `DependencyTaskDetailModal` opens
6. Employee updates status ‚Üí Progress tracked
7. Employee completes ‚Üí Manager accepts
8. All accepted ‚Üí Parent task auto-unblocks

**If NOT working**:
- Check console logs for errors
- Run diagnostic SQL queries
- Verify RLS policies
- Check user roles and IDs
- Test with manual SQL insert

**All code is in place!** The issue is likely:
- Dependencies not being created (check console)
- Data not loading (check SQL query)
- RLS blocking access (check policies)
- Wrong user ID (verify assignment)

---

**Next Step**: Test the complete flow with console open and watch for logs! üöÄ

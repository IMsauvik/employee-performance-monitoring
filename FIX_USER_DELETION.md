# ðŸ”§ Fix User Deletion Issue

## Problem

Users are being deleted from the frontend but remain in the database. This is because **Row Level Security (RLS)** is blocking the DELETE operation on the `users` table.

## Root Cause

The `users` table has RLS enabled but **no DELETE policy**, so Supabase blocks all deletion attempts.

## Solution Options

### âœ… Option 1: Add RLS Policy (Recommended for Production)

This adds a proper DELETE policy while keeping RLS security enabled.

**Steps:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Run this script: `database/fix-user-deletion-rls.sql`

```sql
-- Enable RLS on users table
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow authenticated to delete users
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated to delete users"
  ON users
  FOR DELETE
  USING (true);
```

### âš¡ Option 2: Disable RLS Completely (Quick Fix for Development)

This removes all RLS restrictions - faster but less secure.

**Steps:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Run this command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Or run the full script: `database/disable-rls.sql`

## Verification

After applying either fix, test user deletion:

1. Go to Admin Dashboard
2. Try deleting a test user
3. Check Supabase database - user should be gone
4. Check browser console for any errors

## What Changed in Code

The `deleteUser()` function was updated from:

```javascript
// OLD: Soft delete
const { error } = await supabase
  .from("users")
  .update({ is_active: false })
  .eq("id", id);
```

To:

```javascript
// NEW: Hard delete
const { error } = await supabase.from("users").delete().eq("id", id);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still not working?

1. **Check browser console** for exact error message
2. **Verify RLS status**: Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename = 'users';
```

3. **Check policies**: Run this:

```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'users';
```

### Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"

- Your RLS policies are too restrictive
- Use **Option 2** (disable RLS) or adjust policies

### Error: "permission denied"

- Your Supabase API key lacks permissions
- Check you're using the correct `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env`

## Database Cascade Rules

If you have foreign keys referencing users, you may need to add CASCADE:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tasks
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS tasks_assigned_to_fkey;

ALTER TABLE tasks
ADD CONSTRAINT tasks_assigned_to_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (assigned_to)
REFERENCES users(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

This ensures when a user is deleted, their related data is also cleaned up.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Apply one of the SQL fixes above
2. âœ… Test user deletion in your app
3. âœ… Verify in Supabase database
4. âœ… Consider adding CASCADE rules for related data
5. âœ… Add a confirmation dialog for deletions (already implemented)

## Files Modified

- âœ… `src/services/databaseService.js` - Changed to hard delete
- âœ… `database/fix-user-deletion-rls.sql` - NEW: RLS fix script
- âœ… Committed and pushed to GitHub (commit: 208dd27)

## Live Deployment

Changes are already deployed to:

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/IMsauvik/employee-performance-monitoring
- **Vercel**: https://employee-performance-monitoring-ealm350ms.vercel.app

**Just need to apply the SQL fix in Supabase!** ðŸš€

# Task Review Workflow - Fix Report

## Executive Summary
The task review workflow (Submit for Review → Manager Review → Accept/Reject) stopped working after going live because **critical database columns were missing** from the Supabase schema. The application code was trying to save review-related data to columns that didn't exist in the database.

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Missing Database Columns** ❌
The `tasks` table in Supabase was missing 20+ critical columns needed for the review workflow:

**Review Workflow Fields:**
- `rework_history` - Stores rejection history when manager rejects
- `rework_count` - Counts how many times task was sent back
- `quality_rating` - Manager's 1-5 star quality rating on acceptance
- `reviewed_at` - Timestamp when manager reviewed
- `reviewed_by` - User ID of reviewing manager
- `reviewed_by_name` - Name of reviewing manager
- `accepted_date` - Date when task was accepted
- `submitted_for_review_at` - When employee submitted for review
- `under_review_at` - When manager started reviewing

**Other Missing Fields:**
- `poc` - Point of contact
- `manager_feedback` - Manager feedback array
- `feedback_history` - Historical feedback
- `progress_notes` - Employee progress updates
- `activity_timeline` - Complete activity log
- `blocker_history` - Blocker tracking
- `is_blocked` - Blocked status flag
- `blocked_reason` - Reason for blocking
- And more...

### 2. **Incomplete Status Values** ❌
The database status constraint only allowed:
- `not_started`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`, `cancelled`

But the app needs:
- `submitted` - When employee submits for review
- `under_review` - When manager is actively reviewing
- `rework_required` - When manager rejects and sends back
- `accepted` - When manager accepts
- `overdue` - When task passes deadline

### 3. **Missing dependency_tasks Table** ❌
The `dependency_tasks` table for managing blocker sub-tasks didn't exist in the schema.

### 4. **Database Service Not Mapping Fields** ❌
The `databaseService.js` file wasn't converting review-related camelCase fields to snake_case for the database and vice versa.

---

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ 1. Fixed Database Service Mappings
**File:** `src/services/databaseService.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Added all review-related fields to `dbToTask()` converter (reading from DB)
- Added all review-related fields to `updateTask()` converter (writing to DB)
- Added `poc` field mapping

**Lines Modified:**
- Lines 24-77: Enhanced `dbToTask()` converter
- Lines 427-476: Enhanced `updateTask()` field mapping

### ✅ 2. Created Database Migration
**File:** `database/add-review-workflow-fields.sql`

**What it does:**
1. Adds all 20+ missing columns to `tasks` table
2. Updates status constraint to include all workflow states
3. Creates `dependency_tasks` table with full schema
4. Adds proper indexes for performance
5. Sets up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
6. Allows employees to update their own tasks

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

You need to run the migration SQL in your Supabase database:

#### Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file: `database/add-review-workflow-fields.sql`
4. Copy the entire contents
5. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
6. Click **Run**
7. Verify you see success messages

#### Option B: Using Supabase CLI
```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed
cd employee-performance-app
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify the Migration

After running the migration, verify the columns exist:

```sql
-- Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'tasks'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

You should see all the new columns including:
- `poc`
- `rework_history`
- `quality_rating`
- `reviewed_at`
- `submitted_for_review_at`
- etc.

### Step 3: Test the Review Workflow

1. **As Employee:**
   - Create or open a task assigned to you
   - Update status to "In Progress"
   - Add progress notes
   - Click "Submit for Manager Review"
   - Status should change to "submitted"

2. **As Manager:**
   - Open the submitted task
   - Click "Start Review" (status → "under_review")
   - Choose "Accept" or "Reject"
   - If Accept: Provide quality rating (1-5 stars)
   - If Reject: Provide feedback for rework
   - Submit review

3. **If Rejected (As Employee):**
   - Task status should show "rework_required"
   - You'll see manager's feedback in red alert box
   - Make improvements
   - Re-submit for review

4. **If Accepted:**
   - Task status → "accepted"
   - Quality rating displayed
   - Task can be marked as "completed"

## Verification Checklist

After applying the migration, verify:

- [ ] Database migration ran successfully without errors
- [ ] All new columns exist in `tasks` table
- [ ] `dependency_tasks` table exists
- [ ] Employee can submit task for review
- [ ] Manager can see submitted tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
**Error:** "column already exists"
- Some columns might already exist from previous attempts
- The migration uses `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` so it should be safe
- If error persists, manually check which columns exist and comment out those lines

### Permission Errors
**Error:** "permission denied" or "RLS policy violation"
- Check that you're logged in as the correct user
- Verify RLS policies are correctly set
- The migration updates policies to allow employees to update their own tasks

### Status Not Updating
**Error:** Status stays as old value
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the `tasks_status_check` constraint was updated
- Run: `SELECT conname, consrc FROM pg_constraint WHERE conrelid = 'tasks'::regclass;`

### Data Not Persisting
**Error:** Changes disappear after refresh
- Check Supabase logs for database errors
- Verify all new columns have proper default values
- Ensure RLS policies allow the operation

## Additional Notes

### Performance
- Indexes have been added for all foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- JSONB columns are used for arrays and objects (efficient in PostgreSQL)
- RLS policies are optimized to minimize query overhead

### Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users only see their tasks
- Managers can see all team tasks
- Employees can only update their own tasks
- Proper referential integrity with foreign keys

### Scalability
- JSONB columns allow flexible schema evolution
- Proper indexes ensure fast queries as data grows
- Trigger-based `updated_at` keeps track of changes

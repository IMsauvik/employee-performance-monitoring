# üìò Creating GitHub Repository from VS Code - Step by Step

Since you're already logged into GitHub in VS Code, follow these steps:

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 1: Initialize Git Repository**

First, let's check if git is already initialized:

```bash
# Check git status
git status
```

If you see "not a git repository", run:

```bash
git init
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 2: Create Repository Using VS Code**

### Method 1: Using VS Code's Built-in GitHub Integration (Easiest!)

1. **Open Source Control Panel**

   - Click on the Source Control icon in the left sidebar (looks like branches)
   - OR press `Ctrl+Shift+G` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+G` (Mac)

2. **You'll see a button "Publish to GitHub"**

   - Click the **"Publish to GitHub"** button
   - VS Code will prompt you to choose:
     - **Repository name**: `employee-performance-monitoring`
     - **Public or Private**: Choose **Public** (required for free hosting)

3. **VS Code will automatically:**

   - Create the repository on GitHub
   - Add all your files
   - Make the initial commit
   - Push everything to GitHub

4. **Done!** üéâ

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 3: Verify on GitHub**

1. After publishing, VS Code will show a notification
2. Click **"Open on GitHub"** to view your repository
3. You should see all your files at: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/employee-performance-monitoring`

---

## üìù **What Files Will Be Uploaded?**

All your project files will be uploaded EXCEPT:

- `node_modules/` (excluded by .gitignore)
- `.env` files (excluded by .gitignore)
- `dist/` build folders (excluded by .gitignore)

This is correct - sensitive data and dependencies won't be uploaded! ‚úÖ

---

## üîÑ **Alternative Method: Using Terminal**

If the "Publish to GitHub" button doesn't appear, use the terminal:

1. **Open VS Code Terminal**: `View > Terminal` or `` Ctrl+` ``

2. **Initialize Git** (if not already done):

```bash
git init
```

3. **Add all files**:

```bash
git add .
```

4. **Make first commit**:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit - Employee Performance Monitoring App"
```

5. **Create GitHub repo using GitHub CLI** (if installed):

```bash
gh repo create employee-performance-monitoring --public --source=. --push
```

OR **Manually**:

- Go to https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `employee-performance-monitoring`
- Make it **Public**
- Don't initialize with README (we have files already)
- Click **"Create repository"**
- Copy the commands GitHub shows and paste in terminal

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 4: Push Your Code**

If you created the repo manually, push with:

```bash
# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/employee-performance-monitoring.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## üéØ **Verification**

After pushing, verify:

1. ‚úÖ Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/employee-performance-monitoring`
2. ‚úÖ You should see all your files
3. ‚úÖ Check that `.env` files are NOT visible (they should be gitignored)
4. ‚úÖ `node_modules/` should NOT be there

---

## üö® **Important Security Check**

Make sure these are NOT in your GitHub repo:

- ‚ùå `.env` file
- ‚ùå `server/.env` file
- ‚ùå Any files with passwords or API keys
- ‚ùå `node_modules/` folder

If you see any of these, they should be listed in `.gitignore`!

---

## ‚úÖ **Next Steps After GitHub Push**

Once your code is on GitHub:

1. ‚úÖ Your GitHub repo is ready
2. ‚úÖ Copy the repo URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/employee-performance-monitoring`)
3. ‚úÖ Continue to **Step 2** in `QUICK_START_DEPLOYMENT.md`
4. ‚úÖ Setup Supabase Database

## üéâ **You Did It!**

Your code is now on GitHub!

**Next Guide**: Open `QUICK_START_DEPLOYMENT.md` and continue from **Step 2: Setup Database on Supabase**

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### "Publish to GitHub" button not showing?

- Make sure you're logged into GitHub in VS Code
- Check: Click your profile icon (bottom left) ‚Üí Should show your GitHub account
- If not logged in: Click profile icon ‚Üí Sign in ‚Üí Sign in with GitHub

### GitHub authentication required?

- VS Code will open a browser
- Authorize VS Code to access GitHub
- Return to VS Code

### Files not showing in Source Control?

- Make sure you're in the right folder
- Check: Terminal shows correct path
- Run: `git status` to see untracked files

  Run in Supabase SQL Editor to verify everything is working:

  -- Check table exists and is empty
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dependency_tasks;
  -- Expected: 0 (new table)

  -- Check RLS is enabled
  SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
  FROM pg_tables 
  WHERE tablename = 'dependency_tasks';
  -- Expected: rowsecurity = true

  -- View table structure
  \d dependency_tasks
  -- Expected: All columns with proper types

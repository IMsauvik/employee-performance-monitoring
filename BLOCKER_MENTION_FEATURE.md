# Blocker Mention Feature Implementation

## Overview

The blocker mention feature allows employees to mention team members when reporting blockers in task discussions. Mentioned users are highlighted in **RED** throughout the application to draw immediate attention.

## How It Works

### 1. Creating a Blocker Mention

When an employee opens a task and goes to the comments/discussion section:

1. **Type a comment** that includes blocker-related keywords:

   - "blocker"
   - "blocked"
   - "blocking"

2. **Mention users** using the `@` symbol:

   - Type `@` followed by the user's name
   - A dropdown will appear with matching users
   - Select the user to mention them

3. **Example Comment:**
   ```
   This task is blocked by @John Smith - we need database access
   ```

### 2. Visual Indicators

#### In the Chat Thread

- **Blocker comments** have:
  - Orange/red gradient background
  - "BLOCKER" badge with animation
  - Mentioned users shown with **RED badges** (ðŸ”´ @Username)
  - Red highlight on @mentions in the comment text

#### In the Activity Timeline

- **Blocker activities** show:
  - Orange/red background with border
  - "BLOCKER" badge with pulse animation
  - Mentioned users in **RED badges** at the bottom
  - Red circle emoji (ðŸ”´) before each mentioned user

### 3. Notifications

When a user is mentioned in a blocker:

- They receive a **notification** with type: `blocker_mention`
- Notification message: "_[Username] mentioned you in a BLOCKER on '[Task Name]'_"
- Clicking the notification opens the task details

### 4. Timeline Integration

Blocker mentions automatically create timeline entries with:

- Activity type: `BLOCKER_ADDED`
- Title: "Blocker Mentioned"
- Description: The full comment text
- Metadata: List of mentioned user IDs
- **RED highlights** for all mentioned users

## Color Coding

### Blocker Mentions (RED)

- Background: `bg-red-600`
- Text: `text-white`
- Ring: `ring-red-300`
- Animation: `animate-pulse`
- Icon: ðŸ”´

### Regular Mentions (Blue/Indigo)

- Background: `bg-indigo-100`
- Text: `text-indigo-700`
- No special animation

- Sees notifications when mentioned

### Manager

## Best Practices

### When to Use Blocker Mentions

1. **Waiting on someone** - Mention the person you're waiting for
2. **Need approval** - Mention the approver
3. **Technical help needed** - Mention the technical lead
4. **Resource access** - Mention the resource owner

### What to Include

- Clear description of the blocker
- Who is being blocked (the team/person)
- What is needed to unblock
- Urgency level (if applicable)

### Example Blocker Comments

```
Blocker: @Sarah Johnson - Need production database credentials to deploy
```

```
This feature is blocked by @Mike Chen - waiting for API documentation
```

```
Blocked by missing requirements from @Team Lead - need clarification on user flow
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mention not showing in dropdown

- Ensure you type `@` followed by at least one character
- Check that the user exists in the system
- Verify you're not mentioning yourself

### RED highlight not appearing

- Ensure comment includes blocker keywords
- Check that mentions are properly detected
- Verify timeline is refreshing

### Notifications not received

- Check that mentioned user exists
- Verify notification system is enabled
- Check browser notifications permissions
